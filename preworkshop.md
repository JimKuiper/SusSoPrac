## Pre-Workshop instructions ##

Prior to the workshop it would be most helpful if attendees could do the
following:

* Install [git](http://git-scm.com/) on their laptop, operating system 
  specific instructions are below.
* Signup for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) user account.

## Installing git ##

To install git on your laptop or system follow the direction specific for 
your operating system.  If you already have git installed and can access
the command from a shell or command prompt you are all set.

## Windows 

* Visit [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/), click on the 
 "Download For Windows" button on the right hand side.
* Once the file named `Git-1.9.2-preview20140411.exe` (or similar) has
  downloaded, Run the installer.
* Follow the install Wizard using the default options except on the 
  "Adjust your PATH environment" screen (6th screen).  On that screen choose
  the second option, "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
* Verify that git is accessible from the command prompt.  From the start menu
  execute `cmd`, this should open a Command Prompt window.  In this window
  type `git` which should return a long help message.  If you get a different
  result contact one of the course organizers before or at the beginning of
  the course for help setting up git.

## Mac OS X

* Check that git is not already install on your system by executing `git` 
  from a Terminal window.  If you do not have git installed the system may
  ask you if you want to install the developers tools.  This is one way of
  installing git but it is a large download, we suggest you say no and 
  follow the next point.
* Visit [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/), click on 
  the "Download For Mac" button on the right hand side.  Install git using
  the downloaded package.

## Linux 

* Check that git is not already install on your system by executing 
  `git` from a shell.
* If not install use your package manager (apt-get or yum) to install the
  version of git provided by your distribution, details can be found on git's 
  [Download for Linux and Unix website](http://git-scm.com/download/linux).
