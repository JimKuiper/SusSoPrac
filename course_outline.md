Course outline
==============

Intended Audience
------------------
This (very) short course in sustainable software practices is aimed at Argonne
EVS [Summer interns](http://www.dep.anl.gov/p_undergrad/summer.htm "Intern page")
who have had very little exposure to the use of version control software,
such as [Git](http://git-scm.com/) or "Social coding", such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/). Of course this makes it perfectly applicable
to others!

Pre Course Requirements
-----------------------

git and signing up for a GitHub account.
